## Full Summary
The previous session ended with the heroes spotting three Martian Tripods heading toward a mortar battery being screened by a couple squads of infantry and a tank.  As the tripods advance, the team takes time to plan their attack, deciding on a multi-prong approach.

[Faceless](player_characters/Faceless.md), [Diamondback](player_characters/Diamondback.md), [Double-Time](player_characters/Double_Time.md) and [Ka-Pow](npcs/friends_and_allies/Ka-Pow.md) all sneak up one flank to head off the trio of tripods and engage them in melee as they pass.  [Professor Polar](player_characters/Professor_Polar.md) and [Amon-Ra](player_characters/Amon-Ra.md) approach from the opposite side to hit them from range.  Meanwhile, [Shard](player_characters/Shard.md) and [Zoltan](player_characters/Zoltan.md) move further ahead to get near the [U.S. National Guard](organizations/US_Government/US_National_Guard.md) position so that they can offer the Guard their support.

On their way in, the team notices that one of the tripods is carrying a different weapon than the [heat cannon](items/Martian_Heat_Ray.md) that they've seen so far.  Instead, its weapon is a long tube affixed to a square box at one end.  Prof Polar and Zoltan quickly come to the conclusion that this must be some sort of artillery weapon and that the group should target that tripod first.

Shard recognizes the man leading the National Guard units as [Lt. Dan Davis](npcs/friends_and_allies/military/Dan_Davis.md), who they met earlier that morning at the farm outside of [Grover's Mill](locations/New_Jersey/Grovers_Mill.md).  He's leading the same two squads of guardsmen and they've been joined by a tank.  The mortar team they're guarding is located several meters back, in the park at the end of the street.  After noticing this, she also spots a bulky figure lurking in the park near a clump of trees.  

Zoltan appears in a puff of smoke atop a building on the opposite side of the street, seemingly coming from nowhere.  The impressiveness of this feat is somewhat undercut by him coughing and choking on the smoke.  As a result, he fails to notice any of the things that Shard just spotted.

As the tripods continue advancing on the National Guardsmen, not seeming to notice the team, Double-Time runs up the leg of the artillery tripod while carrying Faceless.  Before they can reach the top, however, Faceless hauls back and forms his hand into a hammer.  Double-Time cringes at the crunching and tearing sounds from Faceless's flesh and bone re-arranging.  the transformation complete, Faceless slams the giant hammer into the leg of the Tripod.  Unfortunately for the pair, this unbalances the tripod sending it crashing to the ground.  The two heroes barely manage to hang on while avoiding being caught underneath the giant machine.

Zoltan throws up a cloud of smoke between the tripods and the soldiers in order to give the Guardsmen some cover.  At the same time, Prof Polar spots one of the tripods getting ready to fire its heat cannon and he takes a shot at said cannon with his own cold gun.  The shot fails to damage the Martian weapon but does knock its aim off, sending the beam harmlessly off into the park.

Shard erects a pair of crystal barriers in front of the National Guardsmen in order to give them additional hard cover.  As she does so, she notices the strange figure from earlier running with an odd gait across the park, behind the soldiers.  The figure appears to be focused on Zoltan and seems to be wearing some sort of armor.

Amon-Ra, also wanting to protect the soldiers, attempts to conjure an illusion to distract the tripods.  Unfortunately, his magic goes awry and the spell twists off target to strike Ka-Pow!  Not only does the spell miss, but it's very nature is affected as it also fails to create an illusion and, instead, knocks Ka-Pow completely unconscious.

The third tripod opens fire on the National Guard's line, blasting a hole through Shard's barrier and severely burning several of the soldiers behind it, however none die thanks to be protection of the crystal barrier.

As the National Guard returns fire ineffectively, their light weapons unable to penetrate and their heavier weaponry failing to hit, the artillery tripod climbs back to its feet.  One of its tentacles flicks out, brushing Faceless off its leg like a mosquito.

Double-Time runs back up the artillery tripod's leg, reaching its main body.  Once there, he begins hammering on the crystalline viewing port at the front, causing several cracks to appear.

Diamondback uses Prof Polar's grapple gun to launch herself to the top of one of the heat cannon tripods.  Once on top of the canopy, she hauls back for a thundering punch.  The tripod is unable to compensate for the ferocity of the impact and it's legs splay out beneath it as it slams to the ground.  Diamondback also looses her balance, landing on the pavement next to the machine.

The downed tripod gathers its legs underneath it and stands back up.  Turning around, it raises one leg and sends it stomping down on Diamondback's prone form.  At the last instant, she raises her hands, catching the foot and her muscles strain to stop it crushing her.  The pavement underneath her cracks from the pressure, but she holds the leg in place.

The other heat cannon tripod turns around to shoot at Faceless but fails to connect.

The artillery tripod, unable to do anything about Double-Time, fires on the Guardsmen.  Prof Polar, seeing this, fires at its weapon.  His shot impacts the box-like structure on the end of the cannon, causing it to pivot in the machine's grip, just before a silver canister is launched form the end of the tube.  The canister arcs up and to the side, landing somewhere behind Shard.  She and over half the guardsmen are enveloped in a [cloud of oily black smoke](items/Black_Smoke_Launcher.md).  The soldiers immediately collapse to the ground, retching and coughing in the smoke.  Shard is little better off as the smoke fills her lungs and immediately leaves her feeling sick and weak.

Double-Time breaks through the crystal of the artillery tripod.  The pilot apparently panics, sending the tripod crashing to the ground again.

Diamondback, maintaining her grip on the heat cannon tripod's leg, forces her way back to her feet.  She sinks up to the ankle as the pavement buckles under the combined weight of the hero and the Martian war machine.  As she tightens her grip, she gives a twist causing the armor of the leg to crack and buckle.  She's certain she feels some part of the leg's internal mechanics give way.

Unfortunately, this is about the same time that the mortar crew finally finds it's mark, the tripod Diamondback is wrestling with.  Several mortar rounds explode around them both, stunning her but failing to penetrate the tripod's armor.

Amon-Ra attempts to raise a wind near Shard to clear the cloud away, but due to the density of the smoke, he can't quite hone in on her location.  Zoltan, taking a deep breath and holding it, teleports over to Shard and teleports her back out of the cloud.  He then begins doing the same for as many soldiers as he can, starting with Lt. Davis.

The tank gets off one last shot before the crew succumbs to the black smoke.  The shot strikes home, denting the armor but failing to penetrate deeply.
The second heat cannon tripod turns its gun on Prof Polar.  In response, he puts as much energy into his cold field as he possibly can.  When the beam of pure heat hits the field of pure cold, a cloud of steam erupts around the professor but he is left largely unharmed.

Double-Time, seeing Diamondback's predicament, runs between mortar impacts to assist.  Seeing this, Zoltan performs an on-the-fly modification of his entangling ribbon spell, targeting Diamondback to give Double-Time better hand-holds.  Double-Time grabs the improvised handles and drags her into a nearby alleyway, out of the mortar's target area.

Shard, her lungs finally clear, flies toward the mortar team in an attempt to get them to stop shelling her team.  Unfortunately, they can't quite hear or understand her over the sounds of the battle.  As she closes, one of the tripods fires its heat ray at the mortar squad.  She quickly erects a crystal barrier in front of them, in a desperate attempt to save them from being incinerated.  However, a well-timed shot from Prof Polar sends its ray off-target, leaving the soldiers unharmed.

Diamondback, shaking off the effects of being shelled by several mortars, hurls a nearby car at the tripod she'd been struggling with.  The car slams hard into the Martian machine, tangling itself in its tentacles and sending the tripod staggering into a drug store on the opposite side of the street.  She tries not to be concerned with the irony of her having admonished Ka-Pow about private property earlier that day.

Amon-Ra focuses his will and channels it into his Solar Staff.  A solar ray of blinding brightness fires from the head of the staff and penetrates the hull of the last tripod standing, sending it staggering into a hardware store.  Noticing that Ka-Pow is laying unconscious next to that same building, Double-Time rushes over to pull her away before it collapses.

Professor Polar removes one of his gauntlets as he runs over to the tripod that is trying to extricate itself from the drug store and car.  Focusing his cold field into his palm, he reaches out and places it on the tripod's leg.  Air condenses to ice and frost along the leg and up to the machine's hull.  Shortly after, the armor cracks, then shatters and the machine falls silent.

After the battle, the team turns to give medical attention to the National Guard soldiers.  Several have second and third degree burns from the Martian heat rays.  The handful that were pulled from the black smoke in time, including Lt. Davis, are weak but look like they'll survive.  Unfortunately, most of the solders caught in the poison cloud, including the tank crew, do not.

The mysterious armored figure from earlier approaches shard.  Speaking in an odd voice, almost as if speaking from inside a metallic chamber, she is offered a container.  She asks who this stranger is and what is in the case, but the stranger is not forthcoming with answers.

Shard leads the mystery figure to Prof. Polar, who is examining the tripod wreckage and helping secure the crews.  When they arrive, the professor notes that the articulation of the armor couldn't possibly fit a human (human hips simply don't work that way).  The newcomer identifies itself as an [emissary](npcs/other/The_Emissary.md) who has been sent to offer something that will help the heroes in dealing with the invasion.  When Prof Polar opens the case, he finds a cylinder that appears to be just the right size and shape to fit in the barrel of the black smoke launcher.  He is warned not to open it.

Prof Polar presents more questions to the emissary but it is not forthcoming with answers.  Instead, it informs him that he should consider the function and use of the cylinder a test of sorts.

Prof Polar, Ka-Pow! and Diamondback detach the black smoke launcher from the tripod carrying it and prepare to take it back to Prof Polar's lab.  Shard volunteers to assist in investigating the mysterious cylinder.  As they leave, the emissary follows, informing them that it has been instructed to observe, but cannot directly assist.  It's creator's laws have already been stretched in order to bring the cylinder to the heroes.
