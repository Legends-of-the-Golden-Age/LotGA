## Full Summary
On the morning after Halloween, [Amon-Ra](player_characters/Amon-Ra.md) (who had spent the night in meditation and alert for any mystical threats taking advantage of the thinning of the dimensional veils common on Samhain) finally sees the newspaper headlines speaking of a battle between the military and unknown foes somewhere out in rural New Jersey. It apparently all started with a meteor strike witnessed by several people in and around the city, but details are few.  

[Ka-Pow!](npcs/friends_and_allies/Ka-Pow.md) hears a similar report over the radio in the morning. Separately, they each decide that this bears further investigation.   

The group that fought the Martian Tripod ([Diamondback](player_characters/Diamondback.md), [Double-Time](player_characters/Double_Time.md), [Faceless](player_characters/Faceless.md), [Professor Polar](player_characters/Professor_Polar.md), [Shard](player_characters/Shard.md),  [Tarraingteacht](npcs/friends_and_allies/Tarraingteacht.md) and [Zoltan the Magnificent](player_characters/Zoltan.md)) begin examining the alien equipment. As they start, [Lt. Dan Davis](npcs/friends_and_allies/military/Dan_Davis.md) (commander of the [U.S. National Guard](organizations/US_Government/US_National_Guard.md) unit who had also fought the invaders) comes over to thank the group for their assistance. However, he is shortly interrupted by a radio operator running up from the trucks that had been parked down the road. Lt. Davis is handed the radio handset and told that HQ wants a status update. He walks to the side to give his report. It's about then that the group notices that Tarraingteacht has disappeared (unknown to them, she felt she needed to report on this indecent to her superiors). 

With Lt. Davis preoccupied, Prof. Polar and Double-Time! start examining one of the [alien hand-held heat rays](items/Martian_Heat_Ray.md). Unfortunately, lacking both a lab and tools, they cannot figure out a way to open the device without destroying it. Prof. Polar stashes one of the heat rays in his sack for later examination back at his lab.  

At the same time, Faceless tries to figure out how to open up the Tripod. He finds a seam for what might be some kind of hatch, but he cannot tell if it's some sort of entry portal or simply for maintenance. He finds no obvious handholds or controls. Zoltan, watching from nearby, suggests that the controls might be mentally activated as the aliens seemed to be unusually strong psychics. Faceless asks if he might be able to open the hatch. Zoltan tries to use the "secret mental disciplines of the Far East" to open it but fails to find any purchase as the device lacks a mind to mesmerize and the seal is too tight to probe with ectoplasmic fingers.

Shard, who is a living crystal radio is able to eaves drop on Lt. Davis's conversation. She learns that this was not the only alien crash site and that there are around a half-dozen more in the areas around [New England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England). She also learns that the tripods are on the move and their path will have them converging somewhere in or near [New York City](locations/New_York_State/New_York_City/New_York_City.md). The National Guard and Army are planning to intercept the Martians just outside of [New Brunswick](locations/New_Jersey/New_Brunswick.md).

After finishing his report and getting new orders, Lt. Davis informs the group that all of the alien equipment is property of the U.S. Military (he fails to notice the heat ray that Prof. Polar had stashed away). He confirms that there were multiple crash / landing sites that have released the tripods and that they all seem to be heading for New York City. He also informs them that he's been ordered to join up with other units to help in repelling the invasion. When the group volunteers to come along and help, he tells them that he "cannot lead a bunch of civilians into a battle zone." When protests are raised, he repeats himself, with extra emphasis, "I cannot **lead** a bunch of civilians into a battle zone." The group catches the hint.   After the Guard heads out, the group heads back to the town of [Plainsboro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plainsboro_Township,_New_Jersey), where Faceless left his car and [Benny](npcs/friends_and_allies/Benny_Martin.md) is waiting in his cab for Zoltan. On the way, Diamondback offers Double-Time! the use of one of their spare Halloween masks to help hide his identity. As they enter town, they notice a glowing figure flying into town from the opposite direction.  Shard, being the only flier in the group, flies up to see if he's friend or foe. The man is wearing a helmet and cloak of unusual design and carrying a glowing staff. He introduces himself as Amon-Ra.

Amon-Ra, surprised to find a young woman flying up to him, uses his Judgement Gaze to examine her. His mystical sight reveals no sign of [Chaos](misc/Chaos.md) taint and he judges her to be safe enough. Shard, unaware of the examination, invites him to meet the rest of the group. As introductions are made, he sweeps his Judgement Gaze across the entire group and detects no threats. After learning about the ongoing Martian attack, he agrees to help them out.

As he's not a particularly fast flier, he decides to ride in Benny's cab with Zoltan. A lively debate on the nature of magic and what makes a true magician quickly ensues as they get into the cab. Prof. Polar chooses to ride with Faceless in order to "have a radio in each car". This decision is almost certainly coincidental.

On the road to New Brunswick, they begin seeing what appear to be refugees. Most seem to be fleeing south, opposite the direction the group is traveling, but a few are also traveling north. As they head further north, the number of people on the road grows.

In the mean time, Ka-Pow!, who had been taking her motorcycle off-road to avoid the police roadblocks, makes her way back onto the road only to be run back off it by a wildly careening taxi cab. She's forced to lay her motorcycle down in order to avoid a serious wreck. As she picks the bike back up, cursing the taxi driver the whole time, the taxi disappears down the road. As she gets back on her bike, she finds herself outside the small town of Sandy Hills. As she looks around, she notices billowing black smoke coming from the opposite side of town and hears screaming and crashing sounds. She drives into town to investigate.

At nearly the same time, from another direction, the rest of the group comes upon the same town and also notices the black smoke hanging over the western portion of the small town. Amon-Ra and Shard fly up to scout ahead and see a Martian Tripod stomping through town with no regard for the people or property around it. Several houses are already on fire or have been smashed and people are rushing about in a panic. There is no sign of the military nor police.

Ka-Pow! follows the path of destruction and soon spots the tripod as well.

The group divides up into two teams; one to handle the tripod and the other to handle crowd control and rescue. Double-Time! rushes toward the tripod to try to get people out from under its feet. Faceless also bounds toward the tripod with the intention of attacking. Prof. Polar uses his cold rays to begin putting out fires. Amon-Ra attacks with a ray from his staff, but it appears to have no effect. Shard flies toward the tripod and unleashes a barrage of her namesake shards. Most deflect off the machine's hull but a few manage to stick. Zoltan creates an illusion of a twelve-foot angel over the church that the tripod is walking toward. The "angel" starts warning people away from the church and out of the tripod's path. The tripod, ignoring the heroes entirely, continues striding forward and fires its heat ray at the angel. Ka-Pow! guns her motorcycle and drives straight at the tripod. Finally, Diamondback leaps into the air to close the distance.

Shard and Amon-Ra continue flying forward, firing shots at the tripod. Most are ineffectual. As the tripod crashes into the church, Shard switches tactics and attempts to encase one of the tripod's legs in crystal anchored to the church's frame. Unfortunately, the tripod is barely slowed down.  Faceless, Double-Time!, Diamondback and Ka-Pow! continue closing with the machine; none of them having any real ranged attacks.

Zoltan conjures an obscuring cloud of smoke in between the tripod and the civilians from the church in order to cover their escape. He then uses his mesmerism powers to direct the crowd to flee in a safe direction. After that, he vanishes in another puff of smoke only to reappear nearly 80 feet closer to the tripod. At the same time, Prof. Polar hears shouts for help coming form the back of a burning house. He determines the sounds are coming from the second floor and he uses his grappling gun to ascend through a second story window.

Double-Time! is the first to reach the feet of the tripod and begins pulling civilians out of its way. Prof. Polar makes his way to the back bedroom, where he discovers a mother and father who had been trapped there while trying to gather up their children.

After rescuing an elderly couple, Double-Time! runs up one of the tripod's legs and attempts to damage the machine's heat ray but finds it too well armored. Shard manages to land a shot that unbalances the tripod, sending it crashing to the ground. Double-Time! barely manages to jump free and avoid being crushed.  Ka-Pow! comes skidding to a halt directly in front of the Martian machine and jumps off her bike. She then attempts to wrest the heat ray out of its tentacles  but its grip is too strong. 

Prof. Polar, using his grapple gun, carries the mother and one of the children out of the bedroom window and down to the ground. Looking back up, he sees the panicked father looking like he's ready to jump out the window while holding the other child.   

The Tripod stands back up and begins scanning for the artillery piece that managed to knock it over. Double-Time! takes advantage of this distraction to run back up and focuses his next attack on the crystal "window" on the "face" of the machine. The crystal cracks and chips a little under the flurry of blows and the machine is again unbalanced enough to fall back down. Ka-Pow! having been thrown clear when the machine stood up, moves back in to continue trying to wrest the heat ray out of the tentacle's grasp.

Prof. Polar sees the father grab the grapple wire with his bare hand and prepare to use it to slide down. Knowing that this will not only fail to slow the man's fall, it will also slice right through his hand, Prof. Polar quickly activates the grapple's release. However, he's just a fraction too late as the father had already stepped off the window ledge. Thinking quickly, Prof. Polar positions himself under the man and his child and manages to cushion their fall enough to avoid serious injury.

Diamondback finally lands in the melee surrounding the tripod just as it barely manages to stagger back to its feet. With a mighty heave, she rips one of its legs completely off and uses it to bat the machine nearly forty feet, where it collapses into an un-moving heap.

After the tripod is downed, the group continues putting out fires and rescuing civilians. Double-Time!, Faceless and Amon-Ra break open the tripod's crystal window and Double-Time! has to quickly dodge the blast of a heat ray fired by one of the tripod's crew. The three Martians are quickly subdued and restrained.

After this, Ka-Pow! picks up the tripod's heat cannon with a grunt of effort (impressive as the cannon is a metal box fully 12 feet on a side) and then realizes she'll never be able to carry it on her motorcycle. Instead she loads it into the back of a pickup along with her bike with plans on "borrowing" the vehicle to get the cannon back to her father's workshop. This prompts a discussion with Diamondback about stealing trucks not being proper heroic behavior. Prof Polar suggests simply hiding or burying the cannon and coming back for it later.

Shard scans radio frequencies until she comes across a military channel. She breaks onto the line saying, "This is a message for Lt. Davis. One down in Sandy Hill." She's immediately met with demands to identify herself and her unit. She quickly disconnects.

Ka-Pow!, after securing the cannon, heads to the town hall. This happens to be where most of the townsfolk have congregated and she finds a sheriff and his deputy attempting to keep control over the panicked people. She makes her way into the building to find a phone. When she finds one and attempts to call her father, however, she finds that the lines are all tied up and cannot get through.

Amon-Ra communes with his patron, the [God of Wisdom](npcs/other/God_of_Wisdom.md), via his helmet and asks if there is anything known about these invaders. Unfortunately, this falls outside the realm of the deity's influence.

The rest of the group finds the town's general store. While Faceless uses the phone to call the [FBI](organizations/US_Government/FBI.md), the rest raid the store for maps of the area and food for Double-Time!, who's accelerated metabolism has left him starving. Prof Polar and Diamondback make sure to leave a hand-written receipt and money on the counter. Ka-Pow! complains how that's no different than what she was going to do with the truck. Faceless runs into the same problem that Ka-Pow! had with the phone lines. 

On the road to New Brunswick, Prof Polar gets the radio frequency that Shard had used earlier to contact the military. He calls in to try to report their battles with the tripods and demands to know how the military is coordinating their response and where exactly the field artillery is because that's what it's going to take to stop the Martians. He fares no better than Shard, also being met with demands for identification and informed that this is a military-only channel. Eventually the radio operator on the other end gives a code and the channel goes dead silent. 

Faceless asks to borrow Prof Polar's radio and he uses it to call in to the FBI office in New York. He manages to get through to [Special Agent Lawrence A. Williams](npcs/friends_and_allies/fbi/Lawrence_Alexander_Williams.md) (his mentor as foster father) and learns that the Army has been called in to assist the National Guard. Several units, including artillery, have been assembled in New Brunswick to try to stop the tripods before they can reach New York. He also learns that local and state police and emergency services are attempting to evacuate New York and the surrounding area but the suddenness and scattered nature of the attack, along with the speed of the tripods, have made this difficult. Faceless informs Agent Williams that he and some allies have managed to stop two of the tripods so far and that they're now headed for New Brunswick to help.

As the group nears New Brunswick, traffic begins to back up and eventually comes to a dead stop. Amon-Ra and Shard fly up to see what is happening and spot a road block a couple miles ahead where traffic is being forced to turn back around. Prof Polar, having gotten his radio back, starts passively scanning military channels. From listening in, he learns that the attack is actually coming in more to the west rather than directly south and the group leaves the main road to try to make their way around.

As they drive, Benny admits that he's not quite comfortable heading into a 'war zone'. After all, he's just a cab driver. Zoltan understands and tells Benny that he should find a safe place to hole up and ride this out. He sends Benny on his way with his fare and a generous tip. He then gets into the car with Faceless and Prof Polar.

As the group makes their way around the outskirts of the city, they eventually come across a major path of destruction. It appears that the tripods have already arrived and have started cutting their way through the city. The team can hear the booms of artillery shells in the same direction that the path leads. As they follow it, eventually Shard and Amon-Ra spot three tripods heading toward a mortar battery that is frantically trying to hit the quick-moving machines. In their way are a couple squads of infantry, a tank and a couple half-tracks.
