# Those Who See
A loosely affiliated group of minor magicians, psychics and sensitives who actually know what they're doing.

Not a formal or organized group by any means.   Instead, this is a loose connection of 'white wizards and witches' who know true magic and occasionally work together to oppose dark practitioners.  Secretive and insular by nature, very few know who counts as one of the 'sighted'.
