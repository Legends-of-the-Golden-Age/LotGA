# Chaos
One of the prime mystic sources and exists in direct opposition to [Order](misc/Order.md).

Chaos represents the forces of change, including violent changes like destruction, and view stability as stagnation.  Many would rather see the world burn than watch it become a stale bastion of order and law.

While there is no requirement that those allied with Chaos need be evil, many who prefer to live outside societies norms (which many considered evil, do) will side with Chaos in pursuit of their own whims and desires.
