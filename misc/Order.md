# Order
One of the prime mystic sources and exists in direct opposition to [Chaos](misc/Chaos.md).

Order represents the stability and, at its extremes, stagnation.  Many who join forces with Order, view the instability and rampant change of chaos to be abhorrent.  They prefer to try to order the universe with laws and rules so that everything may be understood and processes may be developed for the mastery of one's own environment.  There are those, however, who will take matters to extremes.  Tyrants who wish to impose **their** order on the universe and those people staunchly defend the status quo, even when systemic injustice and oppression are evident.
