# Arizona Crystal

## AKA:
Arizona Diamond

## Details

A large and mysterious crystal that was discovered in an [Antonova Corporation](/organizations/Antonova_Corporation.md) copper mine in Arizona.  The crystal is similar to a white diamond in appearance, but had a different structure that didn't match any other known material. Antonova Corporation scientists were also puzzled by the fact that the crystal came out of the earth looking professionally cut. The crystal also seemed to have an odd "glow" to it in the light rather than the typical sparkle of a diamond.

Recent discoveries suggest that this may have been a long lost [Atlantean Crystal](/items/Atlantean_Crystal.md) of some type.
