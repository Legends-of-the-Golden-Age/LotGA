## Details
This device uses a [magnetic accelerator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railgun) powered by an incredibly efficient capacitor to launch a shell containing a poisonous gas.  The gas is capable of killing an adult man in less than a minute and has even proven capable of seeping through gas masks and damaging exposed flesh and eyes.
The magazine holds 7 rounds.

The gas eventually condenses down to an inert fine crystalline powder (takes roughly 24 hours).
