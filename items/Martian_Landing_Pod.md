# Martian Landing Pod

How the [Martians](/npcs/foes/martians/Martian.md) got to earth.

## Details
Gigantic cylindrical vehicles that carried the Martians and their war machines from Mars to Earth.  A bit over 50ft in diameter and about 100ft long, a single landing pod will house a full-sized [Martian Tripod](Martian_Tripod.md) and at least a dozen troops plus technical crew.  The tripod is secured in a gantry in the central shaft and the outer shell is comprised of several rooms and corridors for quarters and workspace.

The writing found within is typical of the Martian writing found in other places in that it is virtually undecipherable by humans due to its utterly alien nature and the fact that it is written in lettering that only reflects in infrared.  Access is granted via a large hatchway on the flat end of the pod (big enough for a tripod to pass through) and one or more smaller hatches along the sides for troop access.  The smaller hatches have quick-release levers on the inside but the large hatch requires entry via an 8-button code pad.  Theoretically, a radio frequency broadcasting the correct code can be used to open the hatchways from the outside but the correct sequence has never been found.
