## Personality

## Origin
For the first 12 years of his life, Michael grew up in an orphanage in Plattsburg, NY.  He frequently ran away from the orphanage, only to return when things got difficult.  When he was around the age of 13, an FBI agent, Lawrence Alexander Williams, was looking into the orphanage due to some mob money ties. He learned Michael's ability to practically disappear for days and then return, all unseen.  He also learned that Michael had been left at a local hospital by a tall man with ashen skin, intense grey eyes and an odd accent; who claimed he had found the baby in the woods. Agent Lawrence decided to adopt Michael and begin to train him.

It wasn't long before Michael's shape-shifting abilities were discovered.  In order to protect the child, Agent Williams used his contacts to create a false birth certificate for Michael, showing him as having been born at Fordham Hospital in the Bronx, on June 3rd, 1913.

Michael quickly saw Lawrence as a father and a mentor and, at the age of 16, Michael joined the FBI as an novice agent. Michael spends a lot of his free time trying to figure out who his real parents are, wondering if they are like him or if that was the reason they gave him away. While on the job he is a true Patriot who loves his country and will do anything for it.
